## Introduction
Welcome to my Cloud and DevOps Bootcamp journey with xgrid.co! I am thrilled to share my experiences and accomplishments during this exciting learning adventure. This comprehensive README document showcases the tasks I completed, the skills I acquired, and the valuable knowledge I gained throughout this bootcamp.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to xgrid.co for providing me with this incredible opportunity. This journey has been an enriching experience, and I am confident in my newfound abilities, ready to step into the competitive market with confidence and expertise.

Within this README, you'll find details of my progress organized by sprints. Each sprint folder contains more detailed READMEs that provide in-depth descriptions, resource details, and instructions on how to run the code. These resources are designed to help you explore and understand the work accomplished during each sprint.

Now, let's embark on this journey together and explore the world of Cloud and DevOps!

## AWS Service Proficiency
During the bootcamp, I acquired practical knowledge of various AWS services, including but not limited to:

- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Aurora (Relational Database Service)
- CloudWatch (Monitoring and Logging)
- Cognito (Identity and Access Management)
- ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- CodeDeploy (Deployment Automation)
- CodeBuild (Continuous Integration)
- Lambda (Serverless Computing)
- API Gateway (API Management)
- Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
- Blue/Green Deployments
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)


## Sprint 1: Web Application Creation
In Sprint 1, the main objective was to create a web application that interacts with a RESTful public API and stores the results in a database. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

- Set up a Flask-based web application.
- Define routes to handle user input and API calls.
- Dockerize the web application for containerization.

## Sprint 2: AWS Cloud Infrastructure Setup
Sprint 2 focused on transferring the local web application to the AWS cloud. Here's what was achieved:

- Created AWS infrastructure using Terraform, including an EC2 instance hosted in a VPC.
- Configured access policies to restrict access to the EC2 instance.
- Stored REST API results in Amazon Aurora Serverless.
- Set up CloudWatch Dashboards for monitoring.

## Sprint 3: User Authentication and Load Balancing
In Sprint 3, the following tasks were completed:

- Set up AWS credentials for Terraform usage.
- Created a Cognito User Pool for user authentication.
- Configured an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic.
- Implemented HTTPS for secure communication.
- Enhanced backend to fetch data from the database and user authentication.

## Sprint 4: ECS Blue/Green Deployment
The final sprint involved automating the deployment process using Blue/Green deployment on ECS. Key tasks included:

- Creating a CodeBuild project to build updated task definitions.
- Setting up a pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages.
- Deploying the updated task definition using CodeDeploy.
- Streamlining application deployment in the ECS environment.
